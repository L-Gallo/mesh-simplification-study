ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

This mesh simplification benchmark is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later due to 
dependencies on CGAL's Surface_mesh_simplification package, which is GPL-licensed.

ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH USE

This software is free to use for:
- Academic research and education
- Scientific publications and reproducibility
- Open-source game development projects
- Non-commercial applications

COMMERCIAL USE

Commercial use is permitted under GPL-3.0 terms, which require:
- Distributing source code of any derivative works
- Licensing derivative works under GPL-3.0-or-later
- Providing installation instructions and build scripts

For commercial game development where source disclosure is not feasible:
1. Use only the MIT-licensed components (Open3D, meshoptimizer, fast-simplification)
2. Obtain a commercial CGAL license from GeometryFactory (https://geometryfactory.com)
3. Implement alternative mesh simplification without CGAL
